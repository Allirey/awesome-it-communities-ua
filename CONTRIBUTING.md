# How to Add Your Community to the List?

You want to contribute to the Awesome Ukrainian IT Communities List? That's great news!

Please, fork this repository and create a PR to the `main` branch of this repository.

Please, follow simple rules before submitting a PR:

1. Communities should originate from Ukraine or be related to Ukraine.
2. Ukrainian language is welcome and well-understood inside a community.
3. Community can be a Slack or Telegram group, Web forum, YouTube channel, basically everything where people can communicate with each other. Please, do not put links to read-only blogs or Telegram channels here.
4. Community should be active.
5. Check if a community isn't already in the list. It might be a duplicate. The rule of thumb here is to submit a community only if you run it.
6. Use the following format: `[Name](link) - **Platform** - Description.`, where `Platform` describes where your community is hosted e.g. Telegram, Slack, Facebook, Website, etc. Keep the length of the name + description under 280 characters
7. Check if the link is working and pointing to the right location.
8. Check your spelling and grammar.
9. Choose the appropriate corresponding section.
10. The list, after your addition, should be sorted alphabetically.
11. Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
12. If you use a text editor to fashion the pull request, make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
13. New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization, are welcome.
14. Keep descriptions short, sweet and to the point.

## Dead Link Policy

We check all links are valid with the awesome [awesome_bot](https://github.com/dkhamsing/awesome_bot). If links die, we remove them - this saves time for the maintainers, and ensures awesome links. We'd be happy to accept PRs to re-add new links.
